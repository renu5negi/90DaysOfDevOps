# Day 01 Task – Introduction to DevOps and Cloud

---
## 1. My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud

DevOps is not just tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or Jenkins.  
It is a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with better quality through automation, monitoring, and continuous improvement.

Cloud Engineering is about designing, deploying, and managing scalable, highly available, and secure infrastructure using cloud platforms like AWS/Azure/GCP instead of traditional on-prem servers.

Together, DevOps + Cloud focus on:
- Automation over manual work  
- Reliability over firefighting  
- Scalability by design  
- Faster feedback loops

## 2. Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud

I am learning DevOps & Cloud to:
- Build strong real-world engineering skills, not just theoretical knowledge  
- Become capable of deploying and managing production-grade systems  
- Improve my career opportunities in product-based and cloud-native companies  
- Gain confidence in debugging real infrastructure and deployment issues  

I want to move from “knowing tools” to “owning production systems”.

## 3. My Current Level

Current Level:  Working Professional with 4+ years of experience in IT    
Background: Basic Linux, Git, and some understanding of containers & cloud fundamentals.  
Gaps: Real-world CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes internals, production debugging.

## 4. My 90-Day Goals (Clear Outcomes)

By the end of 90 days, I will:

1. **Deploy a production-grade web application on Kubernetes**  
   - With Docker images, CI/CD pipeline, Ingress, monitoring, and rollback strategy  

2. **Build a complete CI/CD pipeline**  
   - From Git commit → Build → Test → Scan → Deploy → Monitor  

3. **Become confident in real-world troubleshooting**  
   - Debugging pods, nodes, services, network issues, and performance bottlenecks  

---

## 5. Core DevOps Skills I Will Build

1. **Linux & System Troubleshooting**  
   - Processes, CPU, memory, disk, networking  

2. **CI/CD Pipelines & Automation**  
   - Jenkins / GitHub Actions, secrets management, rollbacks  

3. **Docker & Kubernetes Debugging**  
   - Containers, networking, resource limits, production failures

## 6. Weekly Time Commitment

Weekdays: **2 – 2.5 hours/day**  
Weekends: **4 – 6 hours/day**  

Total weekly commitment: **~18–22 hours**

This time is non-negotiable.  
Even on low-energy days, I will do at least **30 minutes** to maintain consistency.

---

## 7. How I Will Stay Consistent

- Fixed daily learning time  
- Maintain a daily log of what I learned  
- Focus on hands-on labs over passive watching  
- Push at least one commit per day (notes, scripts, or configs)  
- Weekly self-review every Sunday  
- No zero days – small progress is still progress
